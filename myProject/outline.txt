Once upon a time in a grassy kingdom far, far away there lived a girl named Tina. By the time she reached 80 she was to be married off to the prince in the neighboring kingdom. Rumor had it that he was smelly and someone who was always dancing when he eats. I imagine the princess was happy to be married.
